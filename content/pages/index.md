          Eliminate bosses and others to find items and Cores. Cores are
          powerful items with spiritiual powers. They are all incredible, but
          the goal is to find a Synergy Core. They are your only way out of The
          Dreamscape!

          Use the Synergy Core at a Beacon and your entire team escapes, and
          waits for the other team on a smaller and different world. The
          destabilization starts after the Beacon is activated, as the other
          team races to escape by any means necessary. Failing to escape in time
          means game over, while if they do escape, the join the other team on
          their new world. The last remaining team standing in the new world
          wins it all!
